Awesome! Chase, let's see what it looks like down here.
CHASE (O.S.)
<BARK BARK>  Light! 
CHASE (CONT'D)
Wow.  You're right Jake. This cave is cool - and huge!
JAKE
Let's take the right fork.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Awesome, right?!  Let's see how far down we can go.
CHASE
Careful, Jake, that's pretty steep.
JAKE
Hey, don't worry. I'll take it slow.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Whoops - whoaaa! <IMPACT>
JAKE (CONT'D)
Uh-oh.  My foot's really stuck.
CHASE
Chase is on the case!

JAKE
Ouch!
CHASE OS
Omp! (THEN)  Sorry, Jake.  You ok?
JAKE
Yeah, I'm alright - But this foot ain't goin' nowhere.
CHASE
We need the Paw Patrol! <BARK BARK> Ryder, you there?
CHASE (CONT'D)
Hello? Ryder? (echoes)
RYDER
Chase?
CHASE (O.S.)
<garbled unintelligible hello>
RYDER
Chase come in! Chase?
JAKE
We must be too deep in the cave for your pup tag to work.
CHASE
Don't worry. I'll run up to the mouth of the cave and call Ryder!  Don't move!
JAKE
Dude, I wish I could move.
CHASE
Oh - right. I'll be right back! <BARKING>

ROCKY
<SLURPT> Sorry Ryder - I tagged you a little too hard...
RYDER
<GIGGLE> Guess I'm it.
CHASE (O.S.)
<BARK, BARK!>  Ryder come in!
RYDER
Ok. I can hear you now, Chase.  How's the cave exploring going?
CHASE
Not good. We need the PAW Patrol!
RYDER
What's wrong?
CHASE
We were pretty deep in the cave and Jake got his foot stuck. He says it hurts and I can't get him out.
RYDER
Don't worry, Chase. No job is too big, no pup is too small!  We'll be right there! 
RYDER (CONT'D)
Paw Patrol...

Rubble, I need you and your jack hammer to get Jake's foot loose from the rocks where he's stuck.

Wait! Marshall, make sure you go right at the fork!  Marshall?
RUBBLE
Hey Chase - you didn't see any spiders in there, did you?

Nah - not any big ones, anyway. Come on!  Chase is on the case.
RUBBLE

MARSHALL
Jake?!  JAKE?!
MARSHALL (CONT'D)
Don't worry Jake - I'm almost there!
CHASE
<SNIFFFING> Jake is down this way...
CHASE (CONT'D)
<SNIFFING> But Marshall went down THAT way!
RYDER
Ok.  Rubble - follow the right fork and find Jake.  See if you can get his foot free.
RYDER (CONT'D)
Chase, you and I better get Marshall!
JAKE
Rubble! Down here!
RUBBLE
Hang on Jake - I'll get you free!
RUBBLE (CONT'D)
YIIIKES!! Oh ... hey ... a spider.  Hehe.  Nice spider.
JAKE (O.S.)
Everything ok, Rubble?
RUBBLE
Yeah - just a big, scary spider... <WHIMPERING> (THEN: PUFFING UP) It might be a little scary to Rubble, but to SUPER Rubble it's just a sweet itsy bitsy spider. Excuse me, Spider!

That's lucky.

Marshall can wrap your foot, Jake.
MARSHALL
JAKE
Nice.

Can you stand on it?

I don't know.

A ride home!
